So far, I've fixed a release blocking bug, updated the documentation and revamped the core tests.
Most of my [pull requests](https://github.com/jandecaluwe/myhdl/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Ajck+is%3Aclosed) have been merged into master.
I've also worked on refactoring some of the core decorators and improving the conversion tests.
However, these are not yet ready to be merged.

In the second period, I will focus on improving the conversion modules. More details can be found in my [proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iCoB838KmA59k5svspFmqk5vR-lzuRbCyj0vtda5W0I/edit?usp=sharing).
